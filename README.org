For now there is no AUR package for this fork, but you can find original script
[[https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rofi-bluetooth-git][here]]

Dependencies: [[https://github.com/davatorium/rofi][rofi]] and bluetoothctl (provided by ~bluez-utils~ in Arch)

Custom keybindings (configurable):
- ~Ctrl+r~ - bluetoothctl power off -> power on (restart)
- ~Ctrl+Return~ - toggle connection to selected device without entering the
  submenu
- ~Alx+x~ - quick forget the device without the submenu

For all configurables see the ~Configurables~ section in the script itself, for
now there is no external config file support because i think its redundant. But
if will be requested by many - will be added.
